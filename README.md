# This's BringBack base from our great GoRhanHee Kernel for Samsung Exynos 9820 Stock Rom 

An optimized stock-based kernel for Samsung Galaxy S10 series (Exynos 9820) with integrated **KernelSU** and **Ramdisk** support.

## 🌟 What is the BringBack Kernel for exynos9820?
This project provides a modified version of the official Samsung stock kernel. It is specifically designed for users who want to maintain the stability of the Stock ROM while gaining advanced root capabilities through KernelSU. And, There was a problem with losing the root(SU) after rebooting, which was a problem with the existing Galaxy 10 series. This is because the stock kernel did not have ramdisk. As a result, the GoRhanHee kernel had ramdisk.

## 🚀 Features
- **Stock Source Base**: Built from the official Samsung Open Source Release Center (OSRC) Kernel Source 
- **KernelSU-Next Integrated**: Included [KernelSU-Next](https://github.com/KernelSU-Next/KernelSU-Next/tree/legacy) 
- **Ramdisk Loaded**: Fixed an issue that did not have ramdisk installed in boot.img. So, We can use Magisk without recovery reboot. Thanks to [@LineageOS Team](https://github.com/LineageOS/android_kernel_samsung_exynos9820)
- **Disabled Samsung Protection**: As Samsung protection is disabled, [APatch](https://github.com/bmax121/APatch) patches are also possible
